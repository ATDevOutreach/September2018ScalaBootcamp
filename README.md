# Scala BootCamp September- December 2018
## Class Two
#### Sum of Multiples
Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

1. Change Directory into the project directory
2. Ensure the code is upto date; pull new all changes from master
````
git pull origin master
````
3. Change to class_two branch
````
git checkout class_one
````
4. Make changes to the branch by making the tests on SumOfMultiplesTest.scala pass

5. Commit the changes to your fork.

6. Make a pull request to the lesson Repo.

#### Objective of the lesson
- Scala collections and Test Driven Development
