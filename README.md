# Scala BootCamp September- December 2018
## Class Three
#### Difference Of Squares
- Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

- The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

- Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
